  <h1>Darth Nihilus</h1>

  <img src="Darth-Nihilus4.jpg">

  <p>This is a Photoshop drawing I made of a fictional character freshman year at LSU from the Star Wars Expanded Universe named Darth Nihilus. A Dark Lord of the Sith from the Old Republic, Nihilus was widely regarded as the most terrifying Sith to ever exist in all of Star Wars media. This was because he was a Wound in the Force, which is a phenomenon or event of mass death and destruction so horrifying that it hurts the Force iteslf. Nihilus was the only survivor of such an event but the power of the wound changed him into a wraith-like creature with an insatiable hunger for the Force. His hunger became so great that he eventually acquired the unique ability drain and feed off of the living Force from entire planets, which wipes out all life and leaves them as barren wastelands. In a way, he can be called the Galactus of Star Wars.</p>
